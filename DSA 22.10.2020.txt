	Computer science is a field that solves various problems using computers.
	A problem can be a easy as calculating sum of two numbers and complex
	as creating robot.


	To solve problem by using computers, you need design an algorithm.
	If you are creating any application there a common thing envolves
	which is data. Therefore study of algorithm involes data structure.


	Algorithm:
		An algorithm is a step by step procedure to solve a problem.

		Q. Calculate sum of two numbers.

		step 1: start the algorithm.
		step 2: let a, b and c be three numbers.
		step 3: accept a and b
		step 4: c=a+b
		step 5: display c.
		step 6: end the algorithm.


		Algorithm have following five properties:

		1) Finiteness
		2) Definiteness
		3) Input
		4) Output
		5) Effectiveness

	
	Multiple algorithm can be used for solving one problem.
	In this situation, an algorithm which provides maximum 
	efficiency should be used for solving a problem.

	
		
	Efficiency can be calculated on the following factors:
		
		1) Time taken by algorithm.
		2) Memory.
		3) Programming Efforts.


		Problem 1:
	
		1) Algorithm 1	-	2s	50  kb	
		2) Algorithm 2  -	1s	100 kb

		time/space tradeoff 



	There are two type of data structures:

		1) Static 
			It is an array. Which cannot grow or shrink
			at run time.

		2) Dynamic
			Which can grow or shrink at run time.


	Techniques for designing algorithms:

		1) Divide and conquer
		2) Greedy approach
